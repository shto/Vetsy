This is an example application that uses the Facebook Graph API to get events and the EventKit framework from Apple,
in order to populate events from Facebook into your Calendar.

I never continued development on this, as with iOS 6.0, Apple provides Facebook integration, which translates
into automatic syncing of Facebook events in the calendar.
