#pragma mark - Facebook Logic

// FBSample logic
// The native facebook application transitions back to an authenticating application when the user 
// chooses to either log in, or cancel. The url passed to this method contains the token in the
// case of a successful login. By passing the url to the handleOpenURL method of a session object
// the session object can parse the URL, and capture the token for use by the rest of the authenticating
// application; the return value of handleOpenURL indicates whether or not the URL was handled by the
// session object, and does not reflect whether or not the login was successful; the session object's
// state, as well as its arguments passed to the state completion handler indicate whether the login
// was successful; note that if the session is nil or closed when handleOpenURL is called, the expression 
// will be boolean NO, meaning the URL was not handled by the authenticating application 
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
            openURL:(NSURL *)url
  sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication
         annotation:(id)annotation {
    // attempt to extract a token from the url
    return [sharedSession handleOpenURL:url]; 
}

// FBSample logic
// Whether it is in applicationWillTerminate, in applicationDidEnterBackground, or in some other part
// of your application, it is important that you close an active session when it is no longer useful
// to your application; if a session is not properly closed, a retain cycle may occur between the block
// and an object that holds a reference to the session object; close releases the handler, breaking any
// inadvertant retain cycles
- (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application {
    // FBSample logic
    // if the app is going away, we close the session if it is open
    // this is a good idea because things may be hanging off the session, that need 
    // releasing (completion block, etc.) and other components in the app may be awaiting
    // close notification in order to do cleanup
    [sharedSession close];
}

// FBSample logic
// It is possible for the user to switch back to your application, from the native Facebook application, 
// when the user is part-way through a login; You can check for the FBSessionStateCreatedOpenening
// state in applicationDidBecomeActive, to identify this situation and close the session; a more sophisticated
// application may choose to notify the user that they switched away from the Facebook application without
// completely logging in
- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application {
    /*
     Restart any tasks that were paused (or not yet started) while the application was inactive. If the application was previously in the background, optionally refresh the user interface.
     */
    
    // FBSample logic
    // this means the user switched back to this app without completing a login in Safari/Facebook App
    if (sharedSession.state == FBSessionStateCreatedOpening) {
        // BUG: for the iOS 6 preview we comment this line out to compensate for a race-condition in our
        // state transition handling for integrated Facebook Login; production code should close a
        // session in the opening state on transition back to the application; this line will again be
        // active in the next production rev
        //[self.session close]; // so we close our session and start over
